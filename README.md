## ✨ Overview

**Event Sentinel** is a real-time, AI-driven event monitoring platform that empowers organizers to detect attendee issues, sentiment shifts, and crowd dynamics *before they escalate*.

Designed with the complexities of large-scale offline events in mind, it centralizes live feedback, analyzes emotions across multiple platforms, and provides actionable insights — ensuring every concern is seen, heard, and resolved.

## 📊 Why We Built This

During high-energy events, it's easy for attendee discomfort or feedback to get lost in the chaos.

> 🎯 Our mission: **Build a solution that lets organizers respond to problems in real time — not after the event is over.**

So, we created a system that:
- Listens to attendees across multiple digital channels
- Analyzes what’s being said with AI
- Visualizes trends, crowd behavior, and alerts instantly
- Helps organizers stay ahead of potential issues — *not behind them*
